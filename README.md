# Deploy-Forensic-Tools
Automated script to install and configure digital forensics tools.

**Note:** This project has been created to serve my own needs. Therefore, the script will install some non-forensic tools and configure the Zsh environment as I need it. Feel free to edit the script on your side to fit your needs :)

## How to Deploy
To quickly set up digital forensics tools on your system, follow these steps:

### 1. Download and Run the Installation Script
You can use either `curl` or `wget` to download and execute the installation script.

#### Using curl

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dysnome/Deploy-Forensic-Tools/main/DEPLOY_WSL_TOOLS.sh)"
```

#### Using wget
```bash
bash -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dysnome/Deploy-Forensic-Tools/main/DEPLOY_WSL_TOOLS.sh -O -)"
```
This script will automatically download and configure the necessary forensic tools on your system.

### 2. Verify Installation
Once the script completes, ensure that the tools are installed correctly. You can verify by running:
```bash
# to be completed
```
